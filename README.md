I am currently learning how to code in python 3.6 through various text books as well as a paid course (https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp) after which I would like to learn some data science (https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp).

I will be uploading my 'milestone projects' here as I have written them, along with notes on how I would like to improve them in the future as I learn more python.
